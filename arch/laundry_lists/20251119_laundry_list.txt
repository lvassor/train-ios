Programme overview page:
"Hey, User". We should always title case the name so we never get "Hey, user" even if the user inputs a lower case name into account creation.
For the MVP we can comment out the streak with the flame emoji in the top right, we won't include that feature.
None of the elements on this page appear glassmorphic or liquidy like on the questionnaire. This is integral for continuity. 
The log this workout button should also be glassmorphic with the glow like the questionnaire, you can fill the colour to green and turn the text to white.
The cards themselves should be glassmorphic all over this page - ensure this is actually implemented.
We can remove the progress bar on the programme overview.
Under programme dropdown, we show a summary of the programme and prioritised muscle groups - all these elements have a hard border and look awful. they should also follow the liquid glass styling.
Lastly - it is absolutely paramount that you now investigate this. I have asked probably a dozen times for this to be corrected. the programme overview displays too many sessions, look at the attached screenshot. even though we have a push/pull/leg split, we display more than 3 sessions. crucially, ONLY the exact number of sessions per week should be displayed. Because this has been missed or mistaken so many times I want you to conduct a longer investigation into this one to understand why it keeps going wrong. Out of the three sessions, if one has been completed it will change colour and be ticked - which should be liquid glass stlying and the subheading will then say 1/3 sessions complete or 2/3 sessions complete.
