Questionnaire: Muscle prioritisation
- male and female shapes occupy different sizes in soace so switching between male to female means she appears larger. they should occupy the same space. 
- both sizes, when equal should also be enlarged.
- rendering bugs: the transition between male and female is strange, the female left deltoid muscle is slower to appear and lags, as does the disappearance of the left male obliques. All shapes shoud load at the same time.
- rendering bugs: female face shape should be light grey like the male face shape. it initially loads for the female and then deisappearsb behind a darker face shape.
- rendering bugs: also something strange about the male neck light grey shape in rear view of the back, it's off centre so pokes out to the left of the male head.this should be removed.
- when selecting a muscle on either male or female, it highlights correctly but the entire image of the model then reduces. this should not happen - colour highlighting should be the only functional change.

Experience levels:

Questionnaire: Days per week availability
- this should now be a horizontal line scroller with a button to pick how many days, now from 1 to 5 - numbers sit above the line. The line should also be coloured up to where the circle has been dragged to, in primary green colour.
- update is to give recommended days per week based on experience level of user. if user selects 0 months or 0-6 months experience we recommend 2-4 days per week. if 6month - 2 yearsor 2+ years we recommend 3-5 days per week. we do this using a line (3 sides of a square with rounded corrners) from the lower range to upper range. sat just on top of the line we annotate with "Recommended".

Questionnaire: All pages
- The ability to scroll should only be allowed on a step if the elements on the page flow off the bottom of the page. For questions like height and weight this is not the case and yet the user can still scroll the page and move it up and down - that should not be possible.
- The fade effect between pages creates too much overlap between elements, can we double the speed of the fade?

Colour palette:
- I want to try a redesign with palettes. take a look at the description below which describes a design i really like
"This is a beautifully crafted dark-mode habit tracker interface with a warm, premium aesthetic. Here's a precise breakdown:
Color Palette
Background: Deep gradient from warm brown/amber (#3D2A1A) at top transitioning to near-black (#1A1410) at bottom. The gradient has an organic, almost smoky quality—not perfectly linear.
Accent Color: Vibrant orange (#FF7A00 or similar) used sparingly for interactive elements and emphasis (the ring around selected day, "Day 1" text, the flag icon).
Text Colors: Pure white (#FFFFFF) for primary text, muted gray/taupe (#8A8078 approximately) for secondary text and inactive elements.
Card/Container: Semi-transparent frosted glass effect with a subtle warm tint—approximately 15-20% opacity white or light brown with blur backdrop.
Typography
Clean sans-serif font (likely SF Pro or similar system font). Hierarchy is clear: large bold title ("Wisdom Takes Work"), medium weight for dates/labels, lighter weight for helper text. Letter-spacing is slightly expanded on labels like "THIS WEEK" and "DAILY PROGRESS."
Component Details
Progress Ring: Thin stroke (~3pt), unfilled state shows subtle gray, the selected/active day has the orange ring outline only (not filled).
Calendar Row: Horizontal scrolling week view with circular day indicators. Each circle is frosted/muted until completed. Current day is highlighted with the orange ring.
Glass Card: Rounded corners (~20pt radius), frosted glass backdrop blur effect, subtle border or inner glow to separate from background.
Progress Indicator: Vertical timeline on the left with connected nodes—hollow circles connected by a thin line.
Visual Effects
The overall feel is warm, premium, and calming—avoiding harsh contrasts while maintaining readability. The warmth comes from the amber/brown hue throughout rather than a cold gray-blue dark mode."
how this would translate into ours is the gradient background. e.g. in the questionnaire the options to click would be the frosted glass semi transparent, same for the programme overview screen.
- you'll notice i've added colour palettes to a json file, add the ones above that you're implementing to the text file as well and then save the json file in the right place - also make sure the json is formatted correctly.
