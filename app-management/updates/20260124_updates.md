# Logger vs Demo vs History.
A core feature of the app is that users can actually undertake a workout session, view their exercises, view the demo & instructional information and view analytics on their historical performance - all achievable through the Logger, Demo and History views, navigable via the Logger view's top toolbar showing Logger/Demo/History.

However, a key structure of the app is that the user can access the same information relevant to an exercise via different routes, i.e. the demo and history pages. As follows:
1. DashboardView -> Click Start Workout -> Workout overview -> Click an exercise -> Opens logger as logger / demo / history (toolbar allows user to switch between the 3).
2. Exercise library (master toolbar) -> Displays all exercises in database -> Click an exercise -> Opens Demo / History (i.e. lacks the logger because they're not actually in a workout, user is just browsing library of exercises).
3. DashboardView -> Browse program -> click exercise card -> Opens Demo / History

So the key distinction is that the user sees only demo / history when accessing via the library, however, what they are presented with is identical to the demo/history they WOULD see via the logger.

Example: User's program is Push Pull Legs. On push day, Barbell Bench Press is included in their program. They click Start Workout on Push day and see their push day overview, including warm up and main exercises. They click on Barbell Bench Press and they are presented with the logger where they can input sets and reps. they can switch to the demo screen to see a video, key muscle groups, equipment and instructions on how to perform a barbell bench press. they flick across to their history to see their historical performance on this exercise. the user then clicks on "Library" on the master tool bar. they scroll through the exercise library and find Barbell Bench Press (same exercise) and click on it. They're presented with the exact same Demo of Barbell Bench Press and can also see their histroy. Navigable by a toolbar that says "Demo | History".

In this way the underlying code is in fact the same - its the same view from a different route, minus the logger becauase it's not relevant in the libary. Library is for browsing and education.

The other key behaviour change in the app is that currently, if a user is in the dashboard, clikcing an exercise card does nothing. if they want to open the logger they have to first click start workout or continue workout (if active) and then see the workout overview, THEN click an exercis and it will open the logger/demo/history.

However, an update for the app is a beahviour change whereby if the user is browsing their program in the dashboard, and they click an exercise card, they then are presented with the same Demo/History page i have just detailed for you for the library route. they can then use the back button left chevron to return home, or use the home button on the master toolbar and it will close the demo/history view. THis is point 3 in the enumerated list above

You need to investigate the current set up and see if the current Demo/History pages IN THE LIBRARY are standalones (i.e. duplicates). if so, remove those and incorproate the above.
