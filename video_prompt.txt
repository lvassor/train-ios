You're looking at the codebase for my fitness app. a critical bug is that 
      videos are not rendering in our onboarding sequence. this is absolutely 
      crucial to the user experience and needs fixing. we have two mp4 files for 
      this. we tried implementing a test view for these but it keeps returning 
      nothing. analyse the attached images, you'll see our test view and the end 
      state target. it cannot be this difficult to run a video in a swift app. 
      apps all over the app store do this. our competitor has done it and they 
      likely used the exact 
        same software as us to edit and output the video. i'm tired of going round
       in circles - consult online swift documentation if you have to but put this
       issue to bed. note that the test view is over and 
      above the interstitial videos in the actual onboarding sequence. i'd recommend analysing these images and then just restarting this 
  feature from the beginning with the mp4 files.
