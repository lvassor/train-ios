## Database & Backend

- **Redesigned exercise database schema** — New SQL structure supporting equipment hierarchy, canonical exercise grouping, complexity levels, and contraindication mappings for injury filtering

- **Equipment hierarchy system** — Implemented two-tier equipment structure with categories (Barbell, Cable, Machine) that expand to reveal specific equipment items (Lat Pulldown, Chest Press, etc.)

- **Contraindications table** — Created injury-to-exercise mapping system linking joint injuries to exercises that should be flagged as potentially aggravating

---

## Questionnaire & Onboarding

- **Expandable equipment selection** — Users can now expand equipment categories to select/deselect specific machines with parent-child checkbox behavior and mixed state indicators

- **Injury question updated** — Changed from muscle-based options to joint-based injury selection (Shoulder, Lower Back, Knee, etc.) that maps to the contraindications system

- **Experience level redesign** — Replaced time-based training history with confidence-based self-assessment (4 levels with friendly, non-judgmental copy)

- **Muscle group selection fix** — Users can now proceed with 0 priority muscle selections; program generation handles empty selection gracefully

---

## Workout Logger

- **Inline rest timer** — Replaced full-screen overlay timer with non-blocking inline timer that appears at top of exercise card, auto-resets on new set completion

- **Keyboard dismissal** — Added "Done" button toolbar to number pad and keyboard inputs across logger and auth screens

- **Contraindication warnings** — Exercises flagged with yellow warning icon when user has recorded injury affecting that movement; tap shows explanatory popup

- **Progressive overload rep counter** — Green badge showing rep increase vs previous session of same type (e.g., +3 reps vs last Push day)

- **Progression/regression prompts** — Updated modal feedback messaging following business rules for load progression coaching

- **Exercise instructions display** — Demo tab now shows numbered step-by-step instructions from database instead of placeholder

- **Library logger bug fix** — Removed logger tab from exercise library detail view; only Demo tab available since there's no active session to log

---

## UI/UX & Design System

- **Charcoal gradient background** — Implemented diagonal gradient (#5E5E5E → #101010 → #0B0B0B) applied to full-screen views only

- **Material distinction** — Full-screen views use charcoal gradient; scroll/card views use .ultraThinMaterial for frosted glass effect

- **Glass lens tab bar** — Apple Phone app-style sliding lens interaction with accent color reveal, rim highlights, and drag-to-select gesture across Dashboard toolbar, Library toggle, and Logger toggle

- **Metal shader refraction** — Custom Metal shader implementing true optical refraction with parabolic (1-r²) distortion formula for physically-accurate magnification at lens center, plus chromatic aberration (RGB channel separation) for rainbow fringing at edges

---

## Cleanup

- **Deleted legacy files** — Removed outdated prompts, scripts, and documentation files that were no longer relevant
